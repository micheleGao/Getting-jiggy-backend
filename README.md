## Description of Getting Jiggy
This API was specifically designed to have the frontend meets the criteria of the Artists, Songs, and Reviews to be built out. The Artist is the main parent of the API, where the subdocuments are the songs and the reviews. Each call has it's own endpoint and each specific review, songs, or artist is found by the id. 

## Inspiration for project`
To have a better grasp of Django Rest Frameworks.
